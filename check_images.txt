Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all 3 architectures correctly classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg as St. Bernard.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, only ResNet classified Dog_02.jpg to be the same breed as Dog_01.jpg. The other 2 architectures identified the dog as a llama.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all 3 architectures correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: All 3 architectures gave the same results for each picture except for Dog_02.jpg. Only ResNet correctly classified it as a St. Bernard but the other 2 didn't even classify it as a dog. So based on questions 1-3, I believe ResNet is best at classifying the 4 uploaded images.
